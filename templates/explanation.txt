Hi {name}! I'm happy to be your helper in all things agenda!

My creator decided to set me up because of a need of communication between the family.
This way, you will be reminded of everyone's events, outings, trips and more on a daily and weekly basis

Isn't that great!? I'm taking some weight of your shoulder xD

This is what I can do so far:
1. Collect and organize your weekly events.
2. Send reminders about special events (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries, trips).
3. Provide daily updates on planned events for the day.

To add events, use this format:
Day: [Day of the Week]
From: [Start Time]
To: [End Time]
Location: [Location]
Description: [Event Details]

For example:
Day: Monday
From: 10:00 AM
To: 12:00 PM
Location: Office
Description: Team Meeting

Let me know when you're ready to add your events!
